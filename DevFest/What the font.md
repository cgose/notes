### Progressive Web Apps 
- Why?
  - Improve user experience
  - **Online and Offline Functionality** 
  - Improved Conversion rates
  - Higher user retention
  - Universal Reach no fragmentation
  - Cross-platform
  - No app store needed

### Machine Learning
- Why?
  - Classification
  - clustering
  - parse data
  - Not Perfect
- Supervised Learning
  - Make sure results fall within certain area
  - Bayesian algorithms
- Unsupervised Learning
  - More to understand data we don't already understand
  - K-means algorithms
- When do we do it
  - Can't hardcode the Functionality
